  ---&#13;
&amp;emsp; I used to read The Prince translated in Chinese version, and cannot have a clear view of what it said. As time goes by, my impression on the book itself faded. Meanwhile, I have seen some films and TV including Machiavellian elements, such as Godfather. With the help of roles and plots on screen, I began to understand some principles in The Prince. In this book, two writers provide more examples corresponding with 22 principles in The Prince to demonstrate the logic behind them. &#13;
&amp;emsp; Before my summary of those specific principles, the hypothesis behind them by Machiavelli is crucial. If we want to know how the principles are derived, those fundamental ones should not be ignored. The hypothesis have three dimensions which are related to the worldview, methodology and value respectively. Firstly, Machiavelli is realistic on how to view people in politics. People act out of self-interest no matter how their rhetoric will be. Secondly, for how to achieve goals in politics, Machiavelli suggests any possible means can be chosen. Any constraints such as moral is put in the second place. Because he thinks success of those special goals will cover the cost. Lastly, &#13;
&amp;emsp; Let’s review and think these 22 lessons:&#13;
1.	Studying and Using History-以史为鉴&#13;
In general, history is collection of past experience. To learn from experience is a realist’s fundamental methodology. And, for history, Machiavelli emphasize one can learn the experience of those great man in history. That is the value of history. To aim high and learn from the great, what you obtain won’t be bad. It’s like Chinese proverb: 取上得中. &#13;
2.	Caress or Annihilate When Taking power&#13;
The reason why there is only caress or annihilate but no mediation is out of self-protection. For self-interest, one must avoid any possibility of being harmed.&#13;
3.	Nip Political Problems in the Bud-防患于未然&#13;
When is the time a problem can be solved with cost as little as possible? Obviously, a very early time, even there just are some signs. This is a realistic principle.&#13;
4.	People Accustomed to Freedom Will Seek It Again&#13;
This reminds me of Chinese practice of SAR, which follows the third way of holding people living at liberty. Machiavelli view 2nd way as best choice, but this doesn’t win free people’s recognition. In global and Internet time, to wipe out is useless. Those people always have ways to affect your state. The Chinese way, to assimilate would be better choice in 21st century.&#13;
5.	The Difficulties of Being a Reformer and the Importance of Having Arms-“枪杆子里出政权”&#13;
Having arm is too important. It’s the foundation of political power system. Chairman Mao has similar saying than independence and liberty both comes from your army.&#13;
6.	Bribery and Dirty Work&#13;
These are two ways of dealing with those people oppose you: to buy or to clean up. What the author emphasize here is different range of two ways. For different rivals, there should be different measures.&#13;
7.	The Problems of Being in Charge without Prior Experience&#13;
This emphasizes the importance of experience, both for person and country. The ruler needs time to learn how to govern and the state needs time to optimize itself so as to lay a solid foundation.&#13;
8.	The Use of Cruelty&#13;
Why cruelty is necessary for governors? Machiavelli explains several reasons: to seize power; to divide people trusted and untrusted; to secure yourself; to defend the country from dangers. Especially he advise the use of cruelty: “injuries should be done all together, so that being less tasted, they will give less offence. Benefits should be granted little by little, so that they may be better enjoyed.” In sum, he views cruelty as a very effective way to achieve leader’s goals. With “The Ends justify the Means”, so it should be kept. Moreover, he advises it should be used for the common good. But, who can guarantee this purpose? From history, the bad caused by cruelty is much more than the good.&#13;
In Chinese thinking, as Laozi points out:兵者，不祥之器, cruelty is the last tool without alternative. It has so much side effects that we must be careful.&#13;
9.	Reliance on the People-群众路线&#13;
In this chapter, the logic behind reliance on the people is revealed. Firstly, the noble is more threatening than the people. Because they “think themselves his equals, and is thus unable to direct or command as he pleases.” Secondly, people are viewed as asking nothing but not to be oppressed. In other words, people tend to rely on you, if you rely on them. &#13;
For CCP’s 群众路线, there are practical reasons to rely the people.&#13;
10.	Rally 'Round the Flag&#13;
Make your followers happy, and they will rally around you. By this rally effect, you can overcome many difficulties.&#13;
11.	Power Can Be Exercised in Any Institution&#13;
This discusses Machiavelli’s understanding of politics. He holds a general definition of politics like contemporary political scholars. &#13;
“Politics is the determination of who gets what, when and how.” By this view, politics can be found and power can be exercised in any institution.&#13;
12.	Keep Your Own Army and Prepare It for War&#13;
Very similar to cha5, point out the importance of owing army.&#13;
13.	Vices versus Virtues and Learning Not to Be Good&#13;
Interestingly, Machiavelli proposes political virtues beyond general moral virtues. For the former, its logic can be complete opposite to the latter. This concept can explain many conspirators’ beliefs.&#13;
14.	Miserliness is Better than Liberality-升米恩，斗米仇&#13;
Insights on humanity. A Chinese proverb has the same description.&#13;
15.	It is Better to Be Feared than Loved&#13;
This is somewhat like above one. But the key point is the balance between two means. Both are required. If anyone surpass, there will be terrible results.&#13;
16.	Deception&#13;
This also involves understanding of human nature. For Machiavelli, human nature obviously tends to be evil. That’s why so many immoral means including deception can be considered. &#13;
Bur the authors don’t completely agree with this lesson. Because they think to deceive is more and more hard and people are not so easy to fool in Internet age. Really? It’s hard to draw a conclusion, as social media is becoming so deceptive. &#13;
17.	The Lion and the Fox&#13;
To combine deception and cruelty, Machiavelli put a vivid expression. But at here, he recommends deception more than cruelty.&#13;
18.	Pick a Side and Stick to Your Decisions in Politics&#13;
This analysis why to be neutral is dangerous and to take side is necessary. Absolutely, it is an extremely important problem in politics. The foundation of the analysis is to calculate and compare political costs between remaining neutral and taking side. &#13;
19.	The Need for Both Military and Popular Support&#13;
Similarly, this is a combination of lesson 5, 8 and 9. In my opinion, to combine is to highlight the balance among different lessons and the limits of those lessons alone. &#13;
But for military and popular support, there should be a first choice. As authors criticized, Machiavelli wrongly choose to appease the military at the expense of people. &#13;
20.	Honor Those with Talent and Hold Festivals&#13;
To keep people loyal, there are some tricks. This reminds me of the famous “3S-Sports, Sex, Screen” policy, which aims to distract people from politics. Obviously, Machiavelli in this lesson has the same attempts.&#13;
21.	Have Few Trusted Advisors and Give Them Wealth to Remain Loyal &#13;
Although this chapter discusses how to deal with advisors, I can connect it with freedom of speech in modern politics. From Machiavelli, only those trusted advisors have freedom of speech, especially in the area of their strength.&#13;
While talking to decision, he emphasizes decision should be made by the prince alone. It is similar to communist party’s democratic centralism.&#13;
22.	Virtue Versus Fortune&#13;
At last, the use of fortune is analyzed by comparing with fortune.  &#13;
